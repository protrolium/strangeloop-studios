# ProcessWire CMS Efficiency Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents several efficiency issues identified in the Strangeloop Studios ProcessWire CMS codebase. The most critical issue is an N+1 query problem that could significantly impact page load times, especially for pages with many child items.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. N+1 Query Problem in index-imgHover.latte (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Location:** `/site/templates/sections/index-imgHover.latte` lines 18-37

**Issue:** The template executes a separate database query inside a foreach loop for each child page to find associated images.

**Code:**
```latte
{foreach $page->children() as $item}
    {if $page->name == 'artists'}
        {var $image = $pages->find("template=music-videos|concert-visuals|broadcast|virtual-reality|brands|cinema|news-item|nft, artist=$item, limit=1")}
    {elseif $page->name == 'collaborators'}
        {var $image = $pages->find("template=music-videos|concert-visuals|broadcast|virtual-reality|brands|cinema|news-item|nft, collaborator=$item, limit=1")}
    {/if}
{/foreach}
```

**Performance Impact:** 
- For a page with 20 artists, this results in 21 database queries (1 for children + 20 for images)
- Should be reduced to 2-3 queries maximum
- Exponential performance degradation as content grows

**Recommended Solution:** Pre-fetch all images in a single query before the loop and use the cached results.

### 2. Redundant Database Queries in default-page.latte (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Location:** `/site/templates/sections/default-page.latte` lines 49-50

**Issue:** Multiple similar queries executed for the same data with slight variations.

**Code:**
```latte
{if $pages->find("artist.name={$page->name}") == true && $pages->find('collaborator.name={$page->name}') == true}
```

**Performance Impact:**
- Two separate queries when one combined query could suffice
- Repeated pattern throughout the template

**Recommended Solution:** Combine queries or cache results to avoid redundant database hits.

### 3. Complex Query in DefaultPage.php (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Location:** `/site/classes/DefaultPage.php` line 5

**Issue:** Complex query with multiple template conditions that could benefit from indexing or query optimization.

**Code:**
```php
return $this->wire()->pages->get("template!=nft, (template=concert-visuals|music-videos|broadcast|virtual-reality|brands|cinema), sort=-date, artist.name='{$this->name}'");
```

**Performance Impact:**
- Complex OR conditions may not use database indexes efficiently
- String interpolation in query could prevent query plan caching

**Recommended Solution:** 
- Consider breaking into separate queries for better index usage
- Use parameterized queries to improve caching

### 4. Inefficient Image Loading in related-items.latte (LOW PRIORITY)

**Location:** `/site/templates/sections/includes/related-items.latte` line 32

**Issue:** Chained method calls with shuffle() and slice() operations on potentially large datasets.

**Code:**
```latte
{foreach $project->children()->not($thisPage)->not($artistParentPage)->shuffle()->slice(0, 3) as $item}
```

**Performance Impact:**
- shuffle() operation on large datasets is expensive
- Multiple filtering operations could be optimized

**Recommended Solution:** Use database-level random ordering with LIMIT instead of PHP-level shuffle.

## JavaScript Efficiency Issues

### 5. Redundant DOM Queries in main.js (LOW PRIORITY)

**Location:** `/site/templates/scripts/main.js` lines 26-45

**Issue:** Repeated forEach loops over the same arrays without caching.

**Performance Impact:** Minor - only affects client-side performance

**Recommended Solution:** Cache DOM queries and use more efficient iteration patterns.

## Recommendations Priority

1. **HIGH:** Fix N+1 query in index-imgHover.latte (implemented in this PR)
2. **MEDIUM:** Optimize redundant queries in default-page.latte
3. **MEDIUM:** Review and optimize DefaultPage.php query structure
4. **LOW:** Optimize JavaScript DOM operations
5. **LOW:** Improve random item selection in related-items.latte

## Performance Testing Recommendations

- Implement database query logging to measure actual query counts
- Use ProcessWire's built-in profiling tools to measure page generation times
- Consider implementing query result caching for frequently accessed data
- Monitor database performance under load with tools like MySQL slow query log

## Conclusion

The N+1 query problem represents the most significant efficiency issue that could impact user experience. The fix implemented in this PR addresses the most critical performance bottleneck while maintaining existing functionality.
